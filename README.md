# Folder Encryption and Decryption Tool

This project provides two Python scripts to encrypt and decrypt files in a specified folder using the `cryptography` library.

## Features

- `encrypt.py`: Encrypts all files in a specified folder.
- `decrypt.py`: Decrypts all encrypted files in the same folder.
- Uses a symmetric key stored in `secret.key` for encryption and decryption.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `cryptography` library

You can install the required library using pip:

```bash
pip install cryptography
